# Ariel

My name is Ariel Kimberly Alexandria (I know it's the worst name combo you’ll ever know). I’m an Angel; my father dragged me to a hotel on Earth for a few reasons really. He says I’m not like the other Angels I'm curious and he says Angels can’t question God's will. They just have to live by his word. I understand that but where has been written down and why does God have all different rules? Question flow in my head as I walk into the elevator from the front desk and find myself sharing the elevator car with a young man about my age (so I’d have to say 18 years of age)."What floor?” he asked

# Abaddon

"Daaaad why did you have to drag me here" A boy of about 18 whines to a man who looks about 60 as they walk around the hotel lobby.

"Because son you have to get used to living on Earth...with mortals yes it sounds painful but get over it you're 135,000 years old" he whispers so the human patrons don’t hear

Abaddon groaned as he carried his luggage to his room his body is covered in tattoos, on his left wrist he has a red Anarchist A with a blood red pentacle atop of that, above the pentacle/Anarchist A is a crown signifying he's Hellion aka royalty and below the pentacle/Anarchist A is a dragon signifying he’s Abaddon and on the right the alchemical symbol for sulphur on the right, on the left shoulder a skeleton in medieval armor, with holes in it the skull has a helmet with spikes going down the center, carrying a banner, on his shoulder blade he has a bleeding butterfly. For piercings/jewelry he has snake bites, on his left hand he have a ring with the Anarchist A in red steel the rest of the ring is stainless steel, he also has a skull with a red crown and imprinted on its forehead is a red A. The ones only other immortals can see include various acts of violence and war etched into his body using veins. His tattoos can be seen due to the fact he is wearing a muscle shirt, he has black Levi skinny jeans on, and black Adidas neos with red laces and a black beanie. After checking into the front desk his father wishes his him well and that he doesn’t kill anybody. He then begins his walk to the elevator when he bumps into a girl that seems to be 14 but he can’t tell because of her short stature. He kept glancing over to her it seemed like all time had frozen and he was just awestruck.  

# Next Floor: Hell

"4 please….." she repeated what seems like 1,000 times; Ariel smiled at him as he finally pressed the button and the doors closed “I'm Anna By the way...”

"I'm Quentin…"

"Nice to meet you, um this is going to be a little weird but um what are you doing here….is that to bold to ask?

"It may be to a normal person but trust me I'm no normal person…" He laughed “I'm here on account of my father. He says that I need to live like normal people and should act my age and not like I’m 15 years old. If you ask me he is the one acting like a 15 year old boy…”

"Hey same with me, I guess we're in the same boat…"

"I highly doubt that…"

"Why do you say that?" she asked

"Well let say you're an angel…"

"Um ok...:" she chuckles nervously

"Well I'm a Demon; we don't fit together like a puzzle...and trust me you don’t want to be stuck with me."

"Well way to put a downer on my day. Listen I think I could cheer you up, so why don't we have dinner with each other. Trust me I think it would be a great idea…" The elevator dinged for the 4th floor “Well this is my floor, I’ll see at my room at 7:30, room 459” 

Ariel smiled brightly rolling her bag down the hall to a normal room: one bed, a bathroom and one small T.V. "Great of course dad got me a bedroom like this...the little perfect girl gets the perfect bedroom ugh this is the worst day of my life!” she knew she was overreacting but she didn't care she wanted to kill him….But then again he was her dad. "I’ll get over it” she reassured herself. Still in the elevator Abaddon finished his short, 2 additional floor ride to his room, “How appropriate?” he thought to himself as he looked at the room number for the Emperor Suite which read '666’. He lugged his bags into the gigantic room: one king size in the bedroom accompanying a 55” flat screen, in the living room 2 sectional couches and a 70” with surround sound a very elegant room but empty none the less just as Abaddon felt. He flips the TV in the living room, cracks open a bottle of Jack Daniel’s; then flops on the couch. He falls asleep to the Movie 300.

Ariel sat in her room not have any clue of what to do. She had about 4 hours to kill. She unpacked as the small T.V. played Hetalia in the background. "You're such a child…" a voice said Ariel spun around seeing Antoni (Her best friend) standing in the room. ”Oh my stars in heaven you scared me!”

"You make it sound like I meant to Ariel! I would never try and scare you. I mean what kind of fiancee would I be if I did?"

"You really shouldn't be here you know?"

"Why not? Because you're the most curious Angel of them all?

"Not funny Antoni….plus don't you have a Job to do?"

"Haha when did you start caring about doing your job miss I erased a kids name from the death book."

"Oh my lord would you shut it! Someone might hear you!"

"Alright sorry…..Well I better get back to that job of mine. I love you." He kisses her on the cheek (Angels don't kiss on the lips until their wedding day).

***

Abaddon woke up abruptly and looked at the clock "Shit" he mouthed to himself the clock read in digital letters **7:15**** **he quickly jumped in the shower a few minutes later he was out, he then went to the bedroom flexed his wings, took a swig of blood from a pint bag, then got dressed in a gray vest, suit pants, white button down, and red tie to finish off with black dress shoes. He slicked his hair back then ran to the elevator as he slipped his rings on. He arrived outside Anna's hotel room and knocked waiting for her answer. 

# Hellions in Paris

Ariel (Anna) answered the door dressed in a light pink dress with lace under her breast to the bottom of her belly, and the dress was a little above her knees. She was wearing earrings and her hair was in a high ponytail, she blushed lightly "Hi sorry I didn't answer right away I was just fixing my hair.” She smiled after saying "so anyway, are you ready?”

Abaddon smiled "Yeah sure thing" He reaches for her hand to leadher out of her room but before he does he looks at her awkwardly “Uh you sure you want to wear that?” he asks chuckling

"What's wrong with this?" she asked looking at her outfit.

Abaddon snaps his fingers and a very stylish pea coat comes torest on his and his dates shoulder. Ariel could only think one thing: he's avery show offy Angel who doesn’t care if he gets caught. "That’s better" Abaddon smiles “Ready for dinner love?” he asks in a British accent.

"Love? Um I'm really just a friend I believe…." She said blushing ashade of pink. She was never given any pet names. This was all very new to her, so really she was in the dark about this so called ’date’.

Before Ariel can speak she evaporates with Abaddon into a cloud ofblack smoke she finds herself on a chilly Paris street not far from the Eiffeltower. "Here we are!" Abaddon looks over to the girl noticing she's clinging to him.

"Oh my stars in heaven what are we doing in Paris?!"

"Dinner? I mean we can go to Italy or Germany maybe Spain...if youdon't like France."

"Well I'm not really huge on French cuisine for a few reasons… I’dreally not want to talk about it…"Ariel looked down at the street not wanting to look anyone in the eye.

Abaddon grabs her hand and leads her to a restaurant called Le Meurice-Alain Ducasse. Abaddon takes Ariel's hand and leads her to a table

"Here we are"

"Well you don't listen, do you? I just told you I’m not that bigon all this …" she was trying not to sound sassy but the tone in her voice said otherwise.

Abaddon orders a few things off the menu and a bottle of wine, asAriel looks at what he ordered she totals it to be around $300 US.

"Um are you sure you even have money for all this?" She askedlooking at Abaddon from across the table.

"Just order whatever you want Hun" He smiles softly

"Please don't call me that…" She blushes a bright red rubbing theback of her neck. The Eiffel tower is covered it lights it was very romantic.

After dinner Abaddon gets up, takes a last swig of wine and goes over to the waiter whispers something in his ear and his eyes turn black before returning to normal Abaddon walks back to the table Ariel had noticed both the waiter's and her date's eyes change her dates unlike the waiter turned red.  

"How strange...I don't believe I’ve ever seen an Angels eyes dosomething like that before. No way he couldn’t be the odds of that is close to nothing." She eyed Abaddon as he walked back to the table more closely now. Trying to read him was a harder task than she had though. Everything that happened so far that night was the work of either an Angel with no self-control or a Demon...or something far worse.

# The Spark to Rule them All

"Ready to go Anna?" by now the Angel was a little bit tipsy so she couldn't argue within a millisecond she was outside Abaddon’s hotel room.

"Well that was fun I guess……." She smiled and leaned in closely togive a peck on the cheek which only seemed right do to the fact that she went to Paris with the boy. So as she leaned the boy's head was turned to the door about an inch away from the cheek Abaddon turned his head making their lips meet. The two didn't pull away from each other. If anything Abaddon closed his eyes and grabbed the back of Ariel’s neck pulling her closer to him. Ariel wrapped her arms around the 18 year old boy. The both of them pulled away breathless and then began to kiss again as Abaddon opened the door. Ariel fell into the room with Abaddon shutting the door behind them. The next time Ariel pulled away “Oh my I I I I I……. I have to go, I’m really sorry I had a great time butI can’t do this!” she said and ran out of the room.

"Well that could have gone better…"Abaddon sighed

"What the heck was I thinking I'm so stupid! What was I thinkingkissing him like that! Wait that was my first real kiss! Oh my god!"

Ariel hears glass smashing in the boys room and a few curse words in a language she and everyone in Heaven dreaded...Lation 

Ariel covered her mouth and ran to the elevator pressing the button to go down finally as she reached her room  she pick the up and called Antoni.

"Hello?" He answered  in a sleepy voice

"Antoni! Guess what just happened!"

"Jezz I don't  know Ariel. You found a demon in the same hotel as you, you killed someone. I don’t know."

"Yes I did!"

"YOU KILLED SOMEONE?! ARIEL KIMBERLY ALEXANDRIA!"

"NO ARE YOU CRAZY!?"

"Please just go to bed I'll talk to you in the morning." Antoni hung up the phone.

***

The next morning Abaddon decide to try his luck and take the very beautiful girl out to breakfast hopefully, hopefully, she would say yes but he couldn't tell due to the reaction he received last night. He’s wearing a black v-neck t shirt, khaki skinny jeans, black Addidias Neos with purple laces. He knocked on the door of Ariel’s hotel room. She sat up and yawned as she walked to the door in her pj’s that was long blue fuzzy pants and a white shirt with a quote on the back from Lord of The Flies. She opens the door to find the boy she had make-out with last night standing there dressed for the day." AH!” she screamed and slammed the door in his face.

"Good morning to you too...I just came here to ask you if we could go to breakfast by the way…..you know maybe get to know each other before we make-out again." Abaddon said knowing she could hear him through the door ”Please…”

"I don't know it doesn’t seem right…."

"I'm not asking you on a date."

"How do I know you're not lying?!"

"Open the door and look at me and tell me I'm lying." She opened the door a little taking a peek at the boy stand there not as dressed as she remembered and then opened it all he way.”Please I’d love to take to out of breakfast.”

"Um I guess….but just as friends and not in France in this state!"

It was too late he had already grabbed her hand and evaporated to some random place, of course she really didn't have an idea where but it was in America. "Here we are!”

"I said in this state…"

"Aw come live a little…"

"Where are we?" Ariel asked looking around here the sun had risen a small wind it seemed to be about 11:00 am do to all the people walking about the sidewalks. Seeing Ariel still in her PJ's Abaddon snapped his fingers; she was now wearing a laced maroon top a black skirt, maroon rose earrings black heeled boots with a bow in her hair.

"No where special just a little town in the state of Georgia."

"Why Georgia?"

"Well there is this placed called Scott's BBQ.They have got the best burgers I have ever had!"

"So lunch, not breakfast.."

"Whatever you have to a meal with me a real meal where there's actual talk."

"Alright alright….let's just get this over with."

The two of them walk down a few blocks and into Scott's BBQ. They pick a table near the middle. A girl walks up in the blink of an eye! "Hey y’all my name is Shy and I’ll be your server today. She looks at Abaddon 

"Should I get you the usual Quinn?" She winks knowing his true identity.

"You know me too well don't you?"

"Maybe so and for the lady?"

"The same thing." Abaddon said before she could speak.

"You know her?"

"Yeah we dated for a few months but it felt like I was kissing my sister so we're just friends now." Ariel looked around the place and stopped Antoni sitting at a table with two other boys. Her eye widened and hide her face with her hand. “What's wrong?” Abaddon asked seeing something was wrong.

"We have to leave, like now would be good."

"Why? It's not like you know anyone here. It’s such a small to-"

"Ariel?" Anothoni asked

"Ariel?" Abaddon questioning the name he heard.

"Ariel what in heaven's name are to you doing here?" Antoni asked her walking up to the table.

"Your real name is Ariel as like the mermaid?"

"Ugh Yeah I hate it…"

"Aw that's so cute!" Abaddon said in a somewhat gay tone.

"It's the worst." she blushes a bright red not looking at either of them

"Bitch" Abaddon casually says looking over at Antoni; his half brother.

"Jerk" Antoni replies. Ariel questioned the both of them and the glares the both of them gave each other. “Ariel what are you doing out with this Jerk.”

"You're one to talk little bro." Abaddon said with a smirk.

"Brother?!" Ariel says with a shocked face

"Well half but still a brother." Abaddon said calmly “Seeing that you're so shocked by this I’m guessing you two know each other.”

"You could say that." Ariel said trying to stay calm

"Well little brother your friend and I are trying to enjoy-" Before Abaddon could finish Antoni took a of blow of corn and dumped it on Abaddon's head laughing.

"Hahahaha it's like camp all over again!"

"Oh so that's how we’re gonna play this game?" Abaddon took a glass of water splashing it on his brother’s crotch pants.

"Wait.." Ariel said tilting her head looking at Abaddon then Antoni back to Abaddon ”That's right haha how could I not remember? Your spaghetti head boy it’s been years” Ariel walked to Abaddon taking her handkerchief wiping off the boy’s face. He turned a little pink ”We should probably go back and get you cleaned up, Antoni say sorry first.”

He moaned "I'm I’m sorry." looking down at the floor, and with a roll of the eyes Abaddon and Ariel were back at the hotel.

"So are you gonna kiss me this time too?" Abaddon asked as the two of them stood in front the Emperor Suite doors  

"YOU ASSHOLE YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?! OH MY STARS IN HEAVEN I MISSED YOU SO MUCH." Ariel couldn’t hold back this time  and kissed Abaddon passionately and hard as Abaddon wrapped her leg around his waist and her wrapping arms around his neck and Abaddon held the girl with one hand trying to open his door with his free hand. Finally when he go the door open Abaddon stumbled into the room both arms around the girl as he closes the door with his foot. Ariel and no intention of stopping this time. They had only dreamed about this for year and years and years.

# Remembering Camp

 "Youre so dead Antoni!" A 9 year old Abaddon said wiping the spaghetti sauce out of his eyes and face as noodles cover his head like a hat.

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! You know that's a  good look on you Abaddon." Antoni laughed “Oh Ariel you have the best ideas in the world, this is priceless.” 

"I was only kidding Antoni, but it is a little funny." She giggled, Abaddon shot Ariel a glare. When she caught his gaze she pulled her wings (that she hadn't grown into yet) and wrapping herself in them. she was alway a shy angel and she knew it.

"Oh yeah hide in your pearly white wings, typical angel!"

"Hey you can't talk to her like that!" Antoni said 

"What are you her boyfriend or something?! You totally like her I know you do lover boy. Thats your nickname now lover boy."

"Well then you nickname should be um um…" Antoni was never good at coming up with things on the spot 

"Spaghetti head!" Ariel said

"Yeah Spaghetti head!"

If things couldn't get any worse Michael, Abaddon’s uncle walks into the camp's mess hall.

"Abaddon what in the world is going on in here?!" Michael asked tapping a foot.

"Why don't you ask lover boy over here?" Abaddon said getting the rest of his lunch off of his face, pointing to his half-brother

"I asked you not Antoni, so are you going to tell me what happened?"

"Well why don't you ask the lunch monitor dickbag" Abaddon retorted

Michael goes to raise his hand to his little nephew but Abaddon strikes first.

Michael holds his nose as it starts to bleed "You little shit" and thus the fight starts. Before Michael and Abaddon kill each other Gabriel and Antoni separate the two. 

"Michael look what you did! This kid is not as weak as you make him out to be."

"Shut up Gabriel I can do whatever I want he is my nephew!"

"He is mine as well. Ariel you did really well in healing class I think maybe you should take care of Abaddon." Ariel poked her head out and noded Gabriel carried Abaddon out to the nurse's cabin.

"My uncle is so arrogant" 

"Oh come on Michael isn't that bad." Ariel said getting the first aid kit out of the cabinet. She looked over her shoulder at the angry 9 year old his arms were crossed and he was looking to the left, his face in a ball of anger. “Well look on the bright side.”

"Oh yeah what's the bright side Princess?" Ariel shrugged and walked over to Abaddon with a wet rug and a small bowl of water.

"This may hurt a little." Ariel said sitting on the bed and started to patch up Abaddon's face. “A rather long cut for such a small fight.”

"It's nothing really Ariel" Abaddon smiles softly

"It's looks like you have a smile carved into your face."

He leans forward not expecting the Angels lips to connect with his one time then another, both of them could feel something, after a few moments of awkward silence Gabriel walks in to check on his favorite nephew. 

"How is everything going in here?” he asked with a small smile

Ariel jumped "Yeah everything's fine it's going just great nothing weird on this end nope not at all…."

Abaddon chuckles nervously "Hey Uncle Gabriel….yeah everythings fine no Angels kissing Demons here nope...nope" with that Abaddon vanishes in a cloud of black smoke to his favorite camp spot the docks.

"Ewkay" Gabriel chuckles “Well I have to get going..gotta go calm Michael down”

"Right have fun with that…" Ariel smiled picking up the bowl of water and placing it in the sink. She soon walked out the docks where she knew she would find Abaddon. It was then when Ariel had a wonderful idea. If she could get this boy to open up maybe he would calmer. She pulled a row boat like the ones you find out sitting the front of it in the water.All the while Abaddon questioning her actions.”Hey Abaddon come on let's go! it will be fun, a nice boat ride we can even help each other out with the talent show after dinner tonight!”

"What makes you think I want to go on a dumb boat ride?"

"I don't know, you're always sitting out here and you never go out onto the water. So I was hoping you would at least go out with me...I mean on the boats."

"Ugh fine just this once okay?"

"Okay." she smiles 

"So what are we waiting for?" Abaddon smirks. 

"You're  the boy you have to row, you don’t know what to do when it comes to girl do you?"

Abaddon helps Ariel into the boat, then kisses her hand as she gets in. 

"You know I'm not one for boats...fire and water don’t mix" 

# Back to the Future

Abaddon slowly aroused himself after a night well more like afternoon and night of fiery demonic passion to find Ariel had changed, not into clothes but her once pearly white wings were now a violet ash stained thing of beauty, he smiled softly and took a swig from the open blood pint bag. Abaddon then turns on "Heaven Knows" by the Pretty Reckless. Ariel wakes up just as soon as the song sings “We belong way down below”. Yawning and sitting up looking around seeing she wasn't in her room. It took her a moment to remember what had happened yesterday. She smiled seeing the Hellion awake and getting ready for the day. He turned to her ”Good morning sleeping beauty…”

"Ugh it's morning what's so good about?" The tone in her voice was more sassy than she meant it to be.

"Now now just because your wings changed doesn't mean-"

"What do you mean changed?! They can't change!"

"You sure about that? Because angel wings don't look like that." Abaddon smirked Ariel wrapped herself in her wings and screamed 

"Well that could've gone better…”

"Oh my stars in heaven! What happened to them…?"

"I thought you'd be happy to actually have some color in your life."

"Abaddon I don't think you understand what I just did….I am kinda getting married and I can't be a Demon at my own wedding."

"Well Hellion really, But yeah I guess you could say demon." He said handing her the pint bag ”Now drink up you'll need it, seeing you're a newborn and all.” Ariel gave a look saying *you want me to drink that? * “Come on you don't know you don't like it if you've never tried it.”

"There's no way I’m drinking this." She said looking at the blood

"Please just try it…" she puts in in her mouth slowly and slips a little, her eyes widen and Abaddon smiles ”See told you you'd like it.” Ariel smiled and drank half the bag before Abaddon took it from her. “Chill out princess, jezz save some for me.”

"So that's what I've been missing all these years?!"

"Pretty good huh?" Abaddon leaned in for a kiss which was given to him. He smiles pulling away. ”Alright Ariel now get up get dressed.” Ariel flopped back down on the bed.

"Ugh Can't I just stay in bed all day?"

"No we--well yes and no because I guess humans are pretty lazy" Abaddon chuckles and kisses the recently turned Angel “To quote Aladdin and yes I snooped on your vessels file and well facebook but anyway I can show you the world” 

"You really know how to sweet talk a girl."

"It's my speciality" Abaddon says smiling at Ariel softly and flicks on his immortal tattoos, of course mortals couldn’t see them so he looked normal but to Ariel his skin glowed red like the embers of Hell showing his various violent tattoos. Now that Ariel had a connecting moment with Abaddon she could see his true form: charred bones and dark ash covered maroon wings Ariel couldn’t look over the fact that she was getting married and she was going to have to tell her father and mother sooner than later. But there was never a right time to tell her father anything that didn’t have to do with God or his job. She knew that for a fact. But the real question was if this thing between her and Abaddon didn't last would she be allowed back into Heaven. She was too worried about what may happen to noticed Abaddon was kissing her neck. When he reached her sweet spot she giggled.

"Oh come on we'll get in trouble…"

"I like trouble" Abaddon giggled and bite her neck

"Stop that…" she giggled ”Oh come on stop it knock it off Antoni.”

"Antoni, really? I don't look anything like that dick…I'm the attractive one"

Somehow hearing his name triggered Antoni to appear in the hotel room "Ariel I don't think you understand that I'm on a job right now." Antoni said with his eyes closed after a few moments of silence he opens his eyes seeing the newly turned Angel.”What the name of all things holy are you doing with him?”

"What's wrong brother? You look as if you’ve seen a ghost." He gets up from the bed, still fully nude from last nights activities.

"Put some clothes on jeez" Antoni whines, covering his face

"Like you haven't seen plenty of dicks" Abaddon chuckles, walking over to the dresser he snaps his fingers and is dressed instantaneously in boxers and a t-shirt “That better sugar tits?” he slaps Antoni’s ass as he walks back to the bed and crawls in with Ariel. That’s when it hits Ariel she’s naked. 

# Heaven Nor Hell

As an 9 year old Abaddon stood nervously on the camp stage everyone stared at him "I uh...uhm..I'd like to dedicate this song to someone who feels like my soulmate...she knows who she is" music begins playing as he nervously starts to sing *Angel With A Shotgun* by The Cab. After the song finishes Abaddon flashes out in a cloud of dark maroon smoke. 

# Let's Do The Time Twist

 Abaddon finally got dressed after making love to Ariel a second time. He is wearing a gray button down with the sleeves rolled up, a red tie, black skinny jeans, and dress shoes. Ariel was wearing a simple black dress. 

"Ready to go dance babe?" Abaddon asked her smiling softly.

"I guess--I mean you did turn me and it would be rude not to" Ariel said shyly. 

Abaddon snaps his fingers and they appear in a circa 1960 diner with a jukebox and everything. That's when she realizes she’s really in 1960. As the couple walk into the dinner a waiter says "Dallas I haven’t seen you in forever" he slaps Abaddon on the back and he does the same to the waiter, Abaddon walks over to the Jukebox and searches for one song *The Twist* by Chubby Checker. He finds it and begins to dance with Ariel.

"Where are we?" she asked looking around the diner.

"Tulsa, Oklahoma" Abaddon smiles softly, Ariel looked down at her white and black polka dotted dress. She was less than pleased with her clothing.  

"Oh stop it, there's more color than your pearly white wings"  

"Yeah by one color!"

Abaddon snaps his fingers again and the dots are now a rainbow of colors "Better?"

"Smart ass!"

Abaddon squeezes her ass gently and kisses her cheek "Burger and Malt for Lunch?" 

"That sounds fine, and the ass squeeze was uncalled for"' Ariel said rolling her eyes at him.

"Don't lie you liked it." Abaddon smiled at his date as the song fades out the two walked to the bar. Abaddon ordered for the both of them.

"Angels don't lie." She says in a very sassy tone.

"Well everyone has secrets and technically that's lying" He smiles sheepishly.

"Fuck you!" Ariel says rolling her eye and Abaddon.

"Well you already did that sweetheart" He chuckles

"That is…. yeah I know...and don't say that to loud someone may hear you!"

"Hear what?" A waiter bearing an almost creepy resemblance to Gabriel asks.

"Gabe I go to different time periods so I'm not bothered by others" Abaddon smirks, looking towards his uncle “But then again I don’t mind you cause you’re the fun family member.”

"Wait Gabe? OH MY GOD!" She covers her mouth.

"Ariel?!?" Gabriel asks questioningly. She giggles waving turning a shade of pink.

"I'm kind of on a date Uncle Gabe...Dad has me at the hotel." He groans, a few short minutes later Gabe brings them the food they ordered, a burger, malt, and some fries. 

"That's not Archangel Gabriel is it? The one who told our holy maid that she carried the holy one."

"The very same" Abaddon smiles softly.

"I'm so dead when my dad finds out! He is so gonna say 'Alex you'll never guess who I saw on a date with the unholy son!' I’m so dead!"

"Don't worry Ariel he’s talked a lot about you" Gabe smiles.

# In the Mouth of Madness

When Ariel and Abaddon got back to the hotel Antoni was waiting in his brothers room "Where in heaven name have you been Ariel?"The two hellions show a bit of pain at the word heaven.

As if on cue, Marcus shows up and slaps Abaddon "We had a lunch date mister" he says rather flamboyantly. Ariel giggles at his voice, as Antoni can't help but blush seeing Marcus. 

"Marcus not now, I'm busy terrorizing my little brother"

"I Really don't mind if Marcus stays." Antoni say a little too fast almost to the point where you can’t understand him.

Marcus gets extremely close to Antoni and gropes his crotch, Antoni whines in response "Just right" then vanishes into smoke, his father being a converted demon.

Abaddon and Ariel share a look as Ariel looks at Antoni and asked "Um are you ok? Oh is this because you've never had anyone touch you before?” Ariel was trying to figure out why Antoni was a cherry red at the moment. When really Antoni had a huge crush on Marcus. It all started at camp the same year that Antoni had poured spaghetti on Abaddon's head. 

"What?No I'm fine don’t worry about it, I Just I need to go…" Antoni was looking down at the ground at this point his black hair covering his ice blue eyes ”I’ll see you at the wedding Ariel… you better fix your wings by that point. I love you…” He said with half a heart. 

Abaddon looks at Ariel dramatically and apperates a grand piano to play 'duh duh duuuuh' then sets it on fire.

Ariel rolls her eyes at him and then shoots a look that says '*Really Abaddon now is not the time.' *

*"*We should probably go to my room ya know so we don't have any uninvited guests" suddenly the drapes of the Angels room are a light, Abaddon had neglected to aim properly when he lit the piano on fire.

"Holy Mary mother of God!"Ariel yells,pain shooting in her body as the words roll of her tongue.”Abaddon put it out!!!”

"How the hell do you want me to do that!?"

Ariel then had an idea, she ran over to the ice bucket grabbing it splashing the melted ice on the drapes.

"Aw that's no fun" Abaddon chuckles, smiling softly “but ya know we should seriously go to my room.”

"Put the fire out first!!"

"Ew work...JEREMY" Abaddon yells loudly.

A blue cloud of smoke appears in the room. Inside the smoke was a man about 20 or so with long brown emo hair  his eyes closed when he said "What now?” 

"I can't put the drapes out…" He points to the small fire”

"And you want me too? Ugh work." 

"I'm sure all your high class prostitutes will miss your exorbitant spending sprees if you don't have a job" Abaddon teases.

"Fine I'll put it out," Jeremy rolls his eyes and put the fire out very easy.

"You know I could have done that Jeremy.." Abaddon says sarcastically.

"Then why get me to do it! I can't be-"He stops in the middle of a word looking over at Ariel ”Um who is that?”

"1 because I'm not going to do a job that is really easy, 2 that is Ariel, Christopher's daughter"

"His daughter?! What are you doing with a little Angel!"

"Not just any old Christopher Saint Christopher...and" shoves his finger under Jeremy's nose the universal sign for 'I got laid'.

"Oh I get it, so she is not Angel anymore." Jeremy starts to circle Ariel

"Yeah kinda" Abaddon chuckles nervously.

"Jeremy was it, could you not circle me. Were you a Vulture in another life?"

"Yeah she will do nicely right Abaddon?"

"Meh" Abaddon says letting his arms flap to his sides. “You never know Jeremy”

"That's true just look at what happened with Persephone."Jeremy chuckled a little

"She was a present to me it wasn't supposed to last long just 10,000 years...she was one pain in the neck"

"Yeah well you were with her 10,000 years to long." Jeremy said with a smirk,”But this one on the other hand, I could see her staying around for a while.”

"You really think I enjoyed the bitching from her 'I want to go home, your cock hurts my insides. Why does my vagina burn?' I honestly hope Ariel stays long"

"Um I don't really know what to say to that, thanks I guess."

"Yes my ex is Persephone, really wasn't pleasant neither was banging my sister" I chuckle referring to the waitress from Scott's.

Jeremy laughs "Well I better getting going before Amber figures out I'm not at my post." Jeremy  laughs again and disappeared in his blue smoke again.

"Abaddon, what did he mean by she will do nicely?" Ariel asked

"It's a secret..that means I can’t tell you." Abaddon says in a sing song tone. Abaddon gets up and goes over to the coffee maker, he pours some of the Jack Daniel’s into the coffee pot (yes that can be a thing)

"Abaddon you are full of secrets." she rolled her eyes at him waiting for her coffee.

"You don't mind it has alcohol in right?" Abbadon smiles at Ariel.

'You can't do this we don’t live in Dublin or something! And i’m not Irish, not even a little!"

"Sweetheart I drink a bottle a Jack a day"

"Well I don't drink, we angels have manners you know. We don’t need Alcohol to get our day going. We do just fine without it." Ariel says crossing her arms.

Abaddon pulls out a mirror like tray which has several lines of cocaine on it. He snorts one then offers the Angel the tray.

"Do you know nothing about manners? Young ladies' don’t take drugs. You really don’t listen do you?"

"Oh come on me and my friend Lemmy have done this every morning and drink a bottle of Jack a day and I'm gorgeous"

"Oh I see and that just makes it so much better, eh?"

"Doesn't make it any worse" he does another line then offers it to her again. 

Ariel can hear her father voice in her head saying "*Ariel Kimberly Alexandria, what do you think you're doing?!" *She shakes her head trying to forget his voice at the moment.

Abaddon relaxed and let the cocaine hit his blood stream as he apperated a guitar into his hands.

"Ugh why do I even try with you Helions anymore all of you are the same! Why do I even try with men!" Ariel yells and walks to the door to back to her room.

	Abaddon jumps up and walks in front of the door. "Why so serious?"

        "Move aside," Ariel eyes were not playing around the last thing she wanted was to be joked with. “I'm going back to my room fixing my wings and I’m going to go get married. My life will go back to normal and I can live in peace without seeing Antoni throw himself in a tail spin if my wings are any other color but white on our wedding day.”

"Ariel you and I both know that can't happen without you fessing up to everything that has happened in these short few days"

"You don't think I know that?! I’m a high class angel I know what I have to do. The worst they could do is make me a Fallen Angel. But the thing is my father wouldn’t bring himself to do it. So if you don’t mind I’ll be going now!"

Abbadon new he had to act fast so he did the only thing he thought appropriate, show her himself before the fall, when he was God's favorite nephew. He leans in and gently places his thumbs on Ariel’s temples. She leans back a little wondering what he’s doing. His memories get temporarily transferred to her. 

"Just trust me Ariel." He says soothingly. She nods almost a little unsure of herself.She takes a deep breath in and then out ready for whatever is happening.Flashing lights go by Ariel's face and then a picture almost like a old time shows a man with amazing green eyes and short brown hair with a small boy. The boy looked like Abaddon just younger, in fact it was him.

"Come on my favorite nephew let me see those wings."Abaddon pulled out his once white wings that were way to big for him at that stage in his life.

"Why do I have to be the Angel of Destruction all the pain I cause makes the screaming get louder, they ask me to stop but I don't want to disappoint you or my Dad"

"It is my will I'm sorry you are the last born of your father It must be this way."

"Ok…" Abaddon says rather sadly, knowing he already broke the rules with one of his cases, “I'd still be your favorite even if something bad happened right?”

"You always will be." God smiles down at the small Angel.

"My daddy said you wouldn't because he gave the two humans the apple."

"Nevermind that.Tell your dad that he can stop speaking to me." God said in a harsh tone. Something he didn't do offen.

"But Uncle am I still your favorite?" Abaddon said worried he had made God mad.

"Sorry  Abaddon I just get a little mad when you father speaks for me I can do that myself." God's voice when back to it’s normal softness.

 The small Angel hugs his Uncle then vanishes to work on his cases.

# Sympathy for a Devil

Abaddon can be seen hunched over the lifeless body of a Roman girl.

"Come on wake up! Wake up! You can't do this to me I love you." Abaddon knows that something is tampering with his abilities seeing as he could pass on his self healing/reanimating ability to others but it was restricted to other Angels by law. Suddenly he could feel the shadow of two very powerful Angels Christopher and Michael.

"She's gone!" Michael say with no side of sadness to it.

"She can't be gone I’ve been reanimating her for years" Abaddon starts to cry.

"Abaddon we are also here to tell you that you are becoming a Fallen Angel." Michael says running a finger down Abaddon's back.

"W-w-why?" He shudders his wings unfurling from his shoulder blades. 

"Now hold still." Christopher say as Michael pulls out his sword. Abaddon starts to shudder as Michael brings down onto Abaddon's wings. There’s a small shriek of agony from Abaddon as they cut off his wings.

"Michael why are you doing this?", Abaddon cries out. 

"It must be done this way!" Michael yells

Abaddon sinks to his knees, his wings regrowing to the present maroon red. 

"Oh and this is you last year at Camp."

"But I can still go as a demon, don't tell me I can’t I’ve seen other demons there."’

"You're not a demon you’re a Hellion. They’re not the same thing." Christopher explained 

"I'm a Fallen Angel I know exactly what I am you filthy heretic" 

"You see things like that should ever be said to a High class Angel such as myself. My sweet  little girl Ariel would never say such things."

"YOU LET VICTORIA DIE BECAUSE YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDED A VESSEL YOU SACK OF SHIT!!" Abaddon screams at him.

"And what if I did? You not even allowed to fall in love with humans."

"WHY DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN REVIVING HER MULTIPLE TIMES?!?"

"Abaddon so help me God, if Ariel wakes up to you screaming I'll send you to Hell right now in a block of ice." Michael says grinding his teeth. 

"Oh look at you Mr. Posterboy, you knew I was doing this!" Abaddon says looking at the Archangel.

A yawn comes from the once from the lifeless body. The girl rubs her eyes. "Michael? Is that you?" the girl say standing up. Abaddon vanishes in disbelief. 

"Who was that?"

"Just some poor soul who didn't want to lose his wife" Michael says, feeling guilty for what he did.

"Maybe we could help him. I mean it is our job after all."

"No he defied God's Will and needed to be punished." Christopher says rather harshly. 

"But Daddy I-"

"Ariel I don't want to hear another word about this heartbroken human. Don’t going looking from him either"

"What if he finds me?"

"He won't find you I promise." Ariel nodded her head at her father. 

Abaddon. exhausted from sharing that memory falls on to the floor.

Ariel drops to her knees next to him.  

"Abaddon I had no idea! why didn't you tell me? I could of helped you!"

"It's fine you did what you were told to" He says out of breath. Ariel helps Abaddon up onto the bed. “You lay down I’ll get you some water.”

He nods "you really don't have to help me," he says smiling.

"No but I want because, because, I think I love you."

Antoni and Marcus can be found a floor below the recently turned Angel and Hellion

"Yes I'm sure about this sweetheart after all Antoni...you approached me" He trailed off as he laid a kiss upon the collarbone of the younger Angel. Chills Ran down Antoni as he felt lips on his skin. The only thing running in his head “premarital sex in wrong.” Antoni inhales deep and then exhales. “You gonna be alright Antoni?” Marcus asked  turning Anthoni to face him.

"I don't know I’m a little nervous that’s all."

"You don't  have to be nervous. It’s me after all. I wouldn’t do anything you don’t want me too."

Marcus placed a gentle hand on the young boys crotch and gently groped it. Antoni jumps a little not ever doing anything like this before.

Marcus begins the ritual of rubbing the boy's crotch as he sucks his neck. "Do you like what I’m doing?" Antoni nodded, who was a shade of red.

"Marcus I...I...I want you right now. “Antoni stammers out

Marcus begins stripping and helping his partner strip. His cock is just as Antoni had imagined. Antoni looked Marcus in the eye with a look that asked '*May I?" *

Marcus bends the boy over the bed slightly as he entered the boy's body. "Mmm..see no need to worry" Marcus smiles as he brings his lips to his lovers. The younger Angel had never been kissed on the lips before. But was a good kisser for his first time. Marcus continues to slide himself in and out of Antoni as he rakes his fingers down the boy's body. He moaned  loving the feeling of the man pounding him.

"Oh Marcus! Yes right there! Please harder harder! You feel so good inside me!'Anotin didn't know this would feel so good. 

Marcus obliges and goes harder into the smaller boy "That's it" Marcus moans as he begins kissing the boy more passionately. Antoni kisses back hoping he is doing this right.

Marcus begins groping the boy's butt as he slides in and out faster preparing to orgasm, of course at some point during the love making he began masturbating his partner so they could achieve orgasm together.

"MARCUS! I THINK I THINK I'M GONNA CUM!!!"

Marcus nods in response and cums into the boy "Go ahead baby." He moans and cums only seconds after his lover.

"I love you Antoni" Marcus moans, then kissing the smaller Angel.

"I love you too Marcus."

There is a lot of awkward panting between the two boys before they curl up on to the bed. A floor above them Ariel is asleep in Abaddon's arms however he knew exactly what just happened. So he calls down to Marcus’s room 

"Really?"

"What you think you're the only one that can fuck?" Marcus laughs into the phone.

"I'm sleeping with his fiancee have some respect" Abaddon chuckled into the phone mic.

"Haha that's right I forgot about that."

"Oh wait nevermind cause you're sleeping with her’s, and ya knows he’s only like 12,000 right?" Abaddon remarks

"Something like that."

"Marcus come back to bed." Antoni says in a somewhat sleep tone.

"Antoni you know we can't do this forever..you’re marrying Ariel and pretty soon I’ll just be a distant mistake"

"I wouldn't call you a mistake…"

"We've done this once we made out once you and I both know that we’ll never be an acceptable couple...All your dad does is call me half blood and spit at me." 

"I don't care what my dad says we don’t have to tell anyone ever. All I know is I want to be with you."

"I can't even tell my best friend and he keeps FUCKING ASKING ME ANTONI, YOU THINK IT’S HARD TO HIDE IT FROM EVERYONE TRY HIDING IT FROM A SPOUSE YOU IMMATURE LITTLE BRAT!" Marcus vanishes into a cloud of smoke.

"WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT TO ME?!" He yells to the air.

***

Marcus can be found in his house throwing randoming things at the wall as well as knocking over a few book shelves, "Fucking kid just doesn't get it I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but I know I can’t because of Ariel. Maybe I should just wait eventually they’ll get sick of each other and maybe I have a chance."

"Marcus, what in God's name are you doing in here? You’ve made a mess of things. Please pick all this up and then come and have dinner. or are you not hungry again?" Marcus’ wife say walking into the living room.

"SHUT YOUR MOUTH WOMAN I'M HAVING A MIDLIFE CRISIS."

"REALLY!? THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THIS WEEK!"

Abaddon walks into the apartment casually, with a crowd of girls "This ladies is a prime example that Male Menopause exists." He beams happily as the girls snap photos of Marcus.

"ABADDON GET THE HEAVEN OUT OF MY HOUSE!" Marcus' wife yells.

Abaddon hisses at Marcus' Wife and vanishes into maroon/black smoke. 

***

Ariel wakes up in the morning to Abaddon making coffee. 

"I can see you're feeling better." She says rubbing her eyes and stretching her new wings.

"Just peachy sweetheart, I made it with actual water this time", Abaddon says the first part rather sarcastically. 

"Haha very funny." Ariel sat up in bed holding the sheets to her chest seeing it was bare from another eventful night.

"I'll be right back. I’m gonna see if my car is here" Abaddon lied to her.

"I didn't you had a car."she titled her head to one side

A short while after they kissed a temporary goodbye someone had summoned him to make a deal with him.

"What I was busy doing something." Abaddon snapped at the summoner who turned out to be St Christopher; Ariel's father.

"I would like to make a deal with you Abaddon." his hands are behind his back and he is standing tall.

"You have my attention" the Hellion chuckles “Alright name your terms.” 

"It has to do with.."He looks over his shoulder to make sure no one is around “with Ariel..”
